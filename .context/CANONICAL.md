| **The Full Port Barbell** | Session 10 | The 4% Star tier structurally relies on maximum leverage at the micro-level (e.g., 309 layers / 31 pips) to create asymmetric payoff sets, accepting total 4% loss as an entry fee. |
| **EEV Reality Testing** | Session 05 (Feb 28) | Applied Economic Expected Value and Law of Ruin cross-domain to interpersonal relationships to bypass covert/emotional contracts. |
| **Input-Conviction Principle** | Case Study (Mar 04) | Athena's conviction is directly proportional to context completeness. Incomplete context → hedged framework (Law #1). Complete context → direct operational verdict. |
