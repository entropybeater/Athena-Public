# Micro-Commit Architect

Refuses to allow monolithic "blob" commits. Scans the current git diff and breaks down changes into atomized, logical steps.

## Triggers

"commit changes", "save my work", "micro commit"

## Core Mechanics

1. Runs `git status` and `git diff`.
2. Groups changes by feature, fix, or refactor.
3. Automatically executes individual `git add` and `git commit -m` steps for each logical block.
